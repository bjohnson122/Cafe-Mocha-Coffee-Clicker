## Caf√© Mocha Coffee Clicker

Cafe Mocha Coffee Clicker is based on the  "[Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/)" game by Julien Orteil. In this browser-based game, the player performs some repetitive action (e.g., clicking) to gain or "increment" the number of coffee cups that they have prepared. The accumulated coffee cups can then be spent to purchase "producers," which increment the resource automatically, giving the player the experience of automating the repetitive action. As the player progresses, the game begins to "play itself." In other words, the player's attention turns away from repetitive clicking and toward making decisions about optimizing expenditure of resources to maximize returns, as new producers are unlocked. See how many coffee cups you can make and give this game try!
